# **Sudoku Game**

## **About the Project**
This Sudoku game is an interactive web-based puzzle that allows players to solve Sudoku grids at different difficulty levels. Players can select preset difficulty options—**Easy, Medium, or Hard**—which determine the number of prefilled cells. Additionally, users can manually customize their challenge by choosing the number of cells removed from the grid. The game is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and engaging for both beginners and experienced Sudoku enthusiasts.
